# Website Checklist

The below checklists are to help ensure that everything that's needed when a site is completed. Use it, print it, change it, whatever you need to do. If you have any suggestions, always feel free to add an issue or submit a PR.

### Before starting
- Log outstanding content
- Setup GIT repository
- Setup hosting account

### Proof read
- Check that landing page content includes keywords and areas

### Analytics test
- Login to Google Analytics and check it's working

### Browser testing
- Check for bugs in supported browsers
    - Internet Explorer 10+
    - Microsoft Edge (current version + 2 previous)
    - Google Chrome (current version + 2 previous)
    - Mozilla Firefox (current version + 2 previous)
    - Apple Safari (current version + 2 previous)
- Display warning message to users of old browsers (<IE10)

### E-mail form test
- Send a test message to your own e-mail address
- Send a test message to the client
- Set a reminder to follow up if you receive no reply within a few days

### SEO checklist
- Relevant page titles (e.g. Building Services in Eltham | My Building Co. | Or for alternative pages, instead of 'About Us', make it conversational but relevant)
- Include the target keyword/search phrase in the page URL if possible.
- Create relevant links to other pages in the site within the content.
- Meta page descriptions and keywords (Most relevant keywords only. I.e. 'Italian Restaurant', not 'Spaghetti Restaurant')
- Describe images with ALT tags (Include business name in Alt Tags)
- Add Linking Data with business details
- Wrap contact information with [Schema](https://schema.org/docs/gs.html) markup
- Ensure titles are marked up with appropriate H tags (Only 1 H1 tag per page, must include city)
- Generate XML Sitemap
- Setup 301 redirections for old URLs (e.g. /services.php => /services)
- Embed Google map
- Check for broken links

### Performance checks
- Combine and minify CSS
- Combine and minify Javascript
- Check that only necassary assets are loaded per page
- Create image size variations for smaller screens where possible
- Optimise and compress images and media
